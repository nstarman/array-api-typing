        Notes:
            Limiting the transpose to two-dimensional arrays (matrices) deviates
            from the NumPy et al practice of reversing all axes for arrays
            having more than two-dimensions. This is intentional, as reversing
            all axes was found to be problematic (e.g., conflicting with the
            mathematical definition of a transpose which is limited to matrices;
            not operating on batches of matrices; et cetera). In order to
            reverse all axes, one is recommended to use the functional
